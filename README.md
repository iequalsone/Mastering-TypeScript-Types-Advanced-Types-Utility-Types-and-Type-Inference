# Mastering TypeScript Types ‚Äì Advanced Types, Utility Types, and Type Inference

Welcome to the **Mastering TypeScript Types** repository! This repo is a companion resource for exploring advanced TypeScript concepts, including advanced types, utility types, and type inference. Each code example illustrates best practices for leveraging TypeScript‚Äôs powerful type system to create safer, cleaner, and more efficient applications.

## üìñ Overview

TypeScript provides a robust type system that helps developers prevent bugs, enhance readability, and maintainability. In this repository, you'll find:

- **Advanced Types**: Understand union, intersection, and other complex types.
- **Utility Types**: Learn about `Partial`, `Required`, `Pick`, `Omit`, and how they help in type manipulation.
- **Type Inference**: See how TypeScript can infer types to simplify your code.

## üîë Key Concepts

### 1. Advanced Types

- **Intersection Types**: Combine multiple types into one, ensuring an object has all specified properties.
- **Union Types**: Allow a variable to hold multiple types, making your code more flexible.

### 2. Utility Types

- **Partial**: Makes all properties in a type optional.
- **Required**: Makes all properties in a type required.
- **Pick**: Select specific properties from a type.
- **Omit**: Exclude specific properties from a type.

### 3. Type Inference

- **Automatic inference** of variable types.
- **Inferring return types** in functions to avoid manual annotations.
